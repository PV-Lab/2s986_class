## Access MaterialsProject.org Data Base 

There are two convenient Python tools to access the database:

1. A convenient wrapper to the Materials API has been implemented in the Python Materials Genomics ([pymatgen](<https://pymatgen.org/>)) library to facilitate researchers in using the MAPI. Please see the [pymatgen wrapper](<https://docs.materialsproject.org/open-apis/the-materials-api/#pymatgen_wrapper>) section.

2. [matminer](<https://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/matminer/>) is another open-source Python library for performing data mining and analysis in the field of Materials Science. It is meant to make accessible the application of state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning algorithms to materials science data with just a few lines of code.

### API keys from
