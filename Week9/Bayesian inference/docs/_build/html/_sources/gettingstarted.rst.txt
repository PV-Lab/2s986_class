Prerequisites
-------------

``bayesim`` has been most thoroughly tested in Python 3.6.

Download
--------

To install bayesim simply type

.. code-block:: shell

  pip install bayesim

Usage
-----
For more details on both usage methods described below, see the :doc:`manual`.

Python / Jupyter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The easiest way to learn how ``bayesim`` works is by stepping through one of the :doc:`Examples </examples>`, which have well-commented `Jupyter notebooks <http://jupyter.org>`_ associated with them and can be run in `binder <https://mybinder.org>`_ with no need to install Python, ``bayesim``, or any of its dependencies locally.

If you are comfortable coding in Python, these examples will also make it clear how to script using ``bayesim``.

Command line
^^^^^^^^^^^^

We have also developed a command line interface which can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

  bayesim yadda yadda yadda...
